# Banglore_House_Price_Prediction
This project leverages machine learning to predict house prices in Bangalore. Using a dataset of 13,000 entries, we conducted data cleaning, feature engineering, and applied various machine learning algorithms with hyperparameter tuning. The final model was deployed on an AWS EC2 instance, with a web application interface built using Flask.
